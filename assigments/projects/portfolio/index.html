                <h1 class="head1">Biography</h1>
                <p>Hello my name is Jose Martinez, I have received a Bachelors Degree in Music Education, and I have
                    been working in the Education Field for five years. I have served as an Academic tutor/Music
                    Instructor. I have assisted students with homework and recreational activities such as robotics, painting,
                    ceramics, slime, sports, photography, hiking. I have taught music theory, Piano, brass instruments
                    and an to Intro SCRATCH Programming course. I also have a side business in the music music industry, I
                    am a member of small musical group, where I serve as a tubist. As today, I am planning to take
                    Programming in Python and continue taking Web Development classes in Fall 2021. Future goals, I am
                    applying for a Masters in Information Systems in Fall 2021, where I will be focusing on Cloud
                    computing/software development. </p>

                <p class="head2">On the other Hand, I have worked on some coding in Visual Basic .Net such as If
                    Statements which includes IF ELSE, IF ELSEIF ELSE, and nested IFs, Loops such as Do while, For.
                    Basic fundamentals of electronics and hardware components are some of the hands on skills that I am
                    currently acquiring. Some of the devices that I have interacted with are multimeters to measure
                    voltage, resistance, and current. For school projects, I have also worked on basic circuits such as
                    parallel and series circuits using different types of components such as resistors, transistors,
                    NPN, PNP, Photocell, LED, Potentiometer. Regarding to other skills, I am comfortable using word,
                    excel, access, HTMl5 and a bit of CSS. Career wise, I am open to learn more from other web
                    developers, I believe that is the best way to learn how to code. My current goal is to work as a
                    front-end web developer and later on transition into the back-end.</p>
