                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Jose Martinez, and my hobby is to play musical instruments. I started with this hobby in 2010 and I have learned how to play three different types of instruments the <a href="http://www.instrumentsoftheworld.com/instrument/164-Sousaphone.html">Sousaphone Tuba</a>, <a href="https://www.schoolofrock.com/resources/bass-guitar/guide-to-buying-your-first-bass-guitar">Electric Bass</a> and the Keyboard/Piano. I have also played in various venues, collaborated with different artists in state of California. About my hobby, there are four main categories or groups of instruments: Strings, Woodwinds, Brass, and Percussion family. Why you enjoy Playing Music&#63; I enjoy doing this hobby because it has given me opportunities to tour with different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Mexican">Regional Mexican Bands</a> and local bands in Los Angeles, California. This hobby has open doors for me to travel to different cities and states. States such as Chicago, Wisconsin, Michigan, Settle and many more states. Playing an instrument reliefs stress, instrument has helped to improve listening and social skills.</p> 
                
                     <p>The following pictures are examples of different instruments&colon;</p>

                <p>How can someone start with this hobby&#63; The first thing is to make sure that you are picking the right instrument and what type of genre you want to play. Strings generally are stringed instruments which have wooden bodies and the strings are nylon, steel or gut. Woodwind Family are hollow cylindrical pipes made of wood, plastic or metal. The Mouthpiece typically has one end that contains a single or double strip of thin wood (a Reed) which vibrated when air if blown across it. Brass Instruments are long hollow brass pipes with bell-shaped. The brass family includes trumpet, frech horn, euphonium, trombone, tuba. The percussion family includes all drums, cymbals, xylophone, glockenspiel.</p>
                
                <p>Here is a short list of most wanted instruments in a band&colon;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Guitar</li>
                    <li>Drums</li>
                    <li>Electric Bass</li>
                    <li>Keyboard</li>
                    <li>Double Bass</li>
                    <li>Trumpet</li>
                    <li>Trombone</li>
                    <li>Tuba</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>General Steps</h2>
            <h2>Choose a Music Instrument</h2>
             <p>One of the most important decisions that you must do when your start with this hobby, is to choose an instrument first and that you really like it. If you choose an instrument that sounds very pleasant to your ears and you like its aesthetics, it will be easier to stay motivated to practice, the main goal is that you enjoy it and have fun. Now, you should ask yourself, Do I want to play in a band&#63; If yes, now you have to choose some specific instruments that are used generally in a band or genre that you are interest into. As for example, lets say that you have interested in rock band, there are usually a set of drums, Lead Guitar, Bass Guitar, Rhythm Guitar and voice. Choose an instrument you think looks cool.</p>

             <h2>Learn the Basics</h2>
             <p>This a very crucial section because you must have the basics down before you play actual songs. You need to learn the major, minor, scales and arpeggios. Get to know your instrument really well. Learn some music theory, it will help you on the long run. You could take lessons with a professional, to check on your technique. Technique is very important because it make your, we as human, we tend to have very bad habits and we always need someone to point those out for us.</p>

                <p>Free resources for learning music theory&colon;</p>

                    </ul>

             <h2>Set Goals</h2>
                <p> Set realist goals as how much time will you spend for practicing. Goal setting helps to keep focus and track of improvement for every day. Your goals need to be realistic for your level of skills, and if your goal is to play the piano like <a href="https://www.steinway.com/artists/arthur-rubinstein">Arthur Rubenstein</a> or the tuba like <a href="http://www.rogerbobo.com">Roger Bobo</a> in six months, your goal is probably not achievable. Instead, set goals that are achievable as learning how to read music and put yourself out there, and contact your local band. One important element for this hobby is that you must practice everyday, consitancy is key. A good way to keep a record of what you are working on is havinga practice log.</p>

                <p> Here is an example of a practice log&colon;</p>

            <h2>Make Friends</h2>
                <p>Learn with a group of friends and perform with and for other people is the best way to get over the anxiety. This way when you in a large audience you will be a more comfortable, and with this hobby, you have to socialized a lot. If you take music lessons, be sure to make friends, most likely you could probably get your first music gig through your friends.</p>

            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
             <p>Whenever you are practicing make sure you take breaks in between. This hobby requires a lot of patience, this is like working out and you are trying to be in shape. Keep in mind that this is a long term hobby that will keep you busy. If you are someone who travels often, it is suggested that you pick a small instrument such as a guitar, flute, violin, trumpet, French horn, Ukulele. One last tip is that instruments are very expensive, make sure to buy one that is within your budget range. In case you do not like the instrument you picked, it is recommended to buy a used instrument at the beginning of your journey. Lastly, there are many physical benefits when learning to play an instrument. For example, you develop muscle memory, articulations using double tongue and tripe tongue with brass and woodwind instruments helps you get stronger lungs.</p>
